In This Project My main goal is to write a python code which can automatically send mails to a bunch of recipients
Some perks of this project are
1) You can avoid  using cc,bcc. Thereby you wont be revealing the information that the mail was sent to whom.
2) Bolding text is an important summarization feature to highlight important points . In this project you can bold
    certain parts of mail and can write the rest in normal which isnt a general feature in normal Automatic Email senders.
3) You can customize each email like mentioning on the top of each mail. "Dear unKNOWN, ".
4) You can schedule your mailing time using windows task scheduler. This is an Alternate way other than the email Scheduler.

Note : The Automatic Email Sender works with only new Gmail account(Very less frequently used account on the device)
        as google blocks the automation for general Emails

Language Used : Python
Required Libraries : Selenium, Pandas

How to use it?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Step 1 - Add the list of Emails in the Recipient_list.csv file
Step 2 - Enter Your Body of the email as normal, bold using the instruction in comment
Step 3 - Enter your login Credentials(sender_email, sender_password) and subject of the mail.

Done!! Now Sit back and relax seeing your code do the mailing :P
